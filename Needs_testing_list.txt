Left to test:
  Does mission end screen show up for other players?
  Does players being spread out make spawning weird?
  Is Phase 1 challenging for (~6) players to assault?
  Is Phase 2 reasonable for (~6) players to fend off?
  Does the enemy assault in Phase 2 stop when all or 1 player leaves the AO?
  Is the hostage's questionable mortality due to server settings?
  Is lightBasedCamo properly tuned?
